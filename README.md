# Page load type

A JavaScript library for page load type detection supporting Signed Exchanges (SXG),
prefetching, Cloudflare cache, Early Hints, and browser cache.

## The problem it solves

When the browser loads a page, you may want to:

- Report failures in loading of Signed Exchanges subresources
- Compare performance metrics (such as LCP) of different load types
- Track the load type in web analytics
- Adjust page behavior based on type (e.g., play videos for fully prefetched websites
  or display fallback images otherwise)

You will find more information in my blog post on
[how to measure and monitor SXG](https://www.pawelpokrywka.com/p/measuring-signed-exchanges-impact).

## Detected page load types

The library recognizes the following page load types:

### SXG

The page was loaded using SXG:

- `sxg_complete_prefetch` - Page was prefetched along with subresources
- `sxg_document_prefetch` - Only the HTML document was prefetched; subresources had to be loaded normally
- `sxg_document_on_demand` - Same as above, but instead of prefetching, SXG was loaded on demand

The browser tried to retrieve SXG but failed because the document was missing from the Google cache.
A fallback mechanism was activated, resulting in the browser being client-side redirected to the website:

- `sxg_fallback_on_demand_edge` - The page was served from Cloudflare cache
- `sxg_fallback_on_demand_hints` - The page was served from the origin, but Early Hints were used
- `sxg_fallback_on_demand_origin` - The page was served from the origin without Early Hints

### Prefetched/cached HTML

If the `prefetched` option (see usage) was specified, then it is possible to determine if:

- `document_prefetch` - The HTML document was prefetched on the referring site
- `browser_cache` - The page was visited before and the browser used the cached version
                    (subresources may or may not be cached)

If the `prefetched` option is unspecified (default), then the page load type will be:

- `document_prefetch/browser_cache` - The page was served from the browser cache,
                                      but it's not clear if it was prefetched or visited previously

### Normal loading

The page was loaded normally. It's still possible to determine if:

- `document_on_demand_edge` - The page was served from Cloudflare cache
- `document_on_demand_hints` - The page was served from the origin, but Early Hints were used
- `document_on_demand_origin` - The page was served from the origin without Early Hints

## Page load type performance rating

Page load types tiers, rated from the best performance to the worst according to my measurements:

1. `sxg_complete_prefetch` / `browser_cache`
2. `sxg_fallback_on_demand_edge` / `sxg_fallback_on_demand_hints` / `document_on_demand_edge` / `document_on_demand_hints`
3. `sxg_document_prefetch` / `sxg_fallback_on_demand_origin` / `document_prefetch` / `document_on_demand_origin`
4. `sxg_document_on_demand`

Note that the 1st tier is much faster, while the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th tiers are quite similar to each other
in terms of speed. For a full explanation and details, see my blog post about
[measuring SXG](https://www.pawelpokrywka.com/p/measuring-signed-exchanges-impact).

## Installation & setup

1. Set Cloudflare to proxy your site and enable the **Automatic Signed Exchanges** feature
2. Follow my [SXG tutorial](https://www.pawelpokrywka.com/p/how-i-took-lcp-down-under-350ms) on how to
   adjust your app code and web server configuration. Read at least the first 2 parts for basic functionality,
   but to correctly handle SXG quirks, I recommend reading parts 3-6 as well
3. Deploy [SXG Status](https://github.com/pepawel/sxg-status) worker to your Cloudflare account and mount it under
   `/sxg/resolve-status.js`
4. Near the top of your `<head>` section, before the first `<script>` element, add:

```html
<script data-issxg-var>window.isSXG = false</script>
<template data-sxg-only>
  <link as='script' href='/sxg/resolve-status.js' rel='preload'>
</template>
```

If you use `npm` to manage dependencies in your app, add the `page-load-type` package:

```shell
npm install page-load-type
```

Adjust accordingly if you use `yarn` or another dependency manager.

## Usage

### getPageLoadType()

`getPageLoadType()` returns a Promise with the page load type. You can use `await` to retrieve it:

```js
import getPageLoadType from "page-load-type";
const loadType = await getPageLoadType();
```

Optionally, you can provide an object with configuration. By default, it looks like this:

```js
{
  prefetched = undefined,
  sxgStatusConfig = {
    scriptPath: '/sxg/resolve-status.js',
    eventName: 'SxgStatusResolved',
    eventProperty: 'subresources',
  }
}
```

The `prefetched` key is a boolean you can use to tell the library if the currently loaded page was prefetched or not.
If specified, the `getPageLoadType()` will be able to differentiate between `document_prefetch` and `browser_cache`.
If not specified, it will return one value: `document_prefetch/browser_cache` for those cases.

From my understanding, setting the `prefetched` key to the correct value requires server-side implementation.
The server has to examine the request headers, look for those related to prefetching, and let the browser know,
for example by embedding it in the HTML. The frontend code could then retrieve the value from HTML and set
the `prefetched` key accordingly.

You can use a Cloudflare worker to achieve this, because the worker can read request headers and modify HTML.
It may be the only option if you use Cloudflare to cache your HTML pages.

The `sxgStatusConfig` key allows you to use a customized [SXG Status](https://github.com/pepawel/sxg-status) worker,
if needed for some reason.

### resolveSxgStatus()

If the only thing that interests you is SXG subresources status, then you can use the `resolveSxgStatus()` function.
It returns a Promise which *resolves* if SXG subresources were correctly loaded and *rejects* otherwise.

```js
import { resolveSxgStatus } from "page-load-type";
resolveSxgStatus()
  .then(() => console.log('subresources loaded with SXG'))
  .catch(() => console.log('subresources failed to load with SXG'));
```

This function also accepts a configuration object with the `sxgStatusConfig` key.

For example usage, see the `example.html` file.
This file is meant to be placed in an SXG enabled website to function properly.

## How it works

The code combines information from various sources:

- SXG document load status provided by Cloudflare ASX in `window.isSXG`
- SXG subresources load status provided by [SXG Status](https://github.com/pepawel/sxg-status) worker
- Browser cache usage retrieved using the `PerformanceNavigationTiming` interface
- Early Hints usage retrieved using the `PerformanceResourceTiming` interface
- Cloudflare cache usage provided by Cloudflare and retrieved using the `PerformanceServerTiming` interface
- Google SXG cache fallback detection by parsing HTTP referrer

For more details, please refer to my blog post about
[measuring SXG](https://www.pawelpokrywka.com/p/measuring-signed-exchanges-impact).
You can also check the `getPageLoadType()` implementation - the function body takes about 40 lines of code.

## Testing

Run tests with:

```shell
npm run test
```
